      "\tAt Stripe, we’ve long been excited about the possibilities of cryptocurrencies and the experimentation and innovation that’s come with them. In 2014, we became the first major payments company to support Bitcoin payments.\tOur hope was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive.\tOver the past year or two, as block size limits have been reached, Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange. Given the overall success that the Bitcoin community has achieved, it’s hard to quibble with the decisions that have been made along the way. (And we’re certainly happy to see any novel, ambitious project do so well.)\tThis has led to Bitcoin becoming less useful for payments, however. Transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions denominated in fiat currencies. (By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it’s for the “wrong” amount.) Furthermore, fees have risen a great deal. For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.\tBecause of this, we’ve seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we’ve seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially. Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense.\tTherefore, starting today, we are winding down support for Bitcoin payments. Over the next three months we will work with affected Stripe users to ensure a smooth transition before we stop processing Bitcoin transactions on April 23, 2018.\tDespite this, we remain very optimistic about cryptocurrencies overall. There are a lot of efforts that we view as promising and that we can certainly imagine enabling support for in the future. We’re interested in what’s happening with Lightning and other proposals to enable faster payments. OmiseGO is an ambitious and clever proposal; more broadly, Ethereum continues to spawn many high-potential projects. We may add support for Stellar (to which we provided seed funding) if substantive use continues to grow. It’s possible that Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, or another Bitcoin variant, will find a way to achieve significant popularity while keeping settlement times and transaction fees very low. Bitcoin itself may become viable for payments again in the future. And, of course, there’ll be more ideas and technologies in the years ahead.\tSo, we will continue to pay close attention to the ecosystem and to look for opportunities to help our customers by adding support for cryptocurrencies and new distributed protocols in the future.\t\n",

      "So many cryptocurrencies. So much money to be made  or lost.  Marketplace Tech host Molly Wood spoke with Martin Weiss, who’s behind the ratings.\t Martin Weiss: As you’ve seen in the news, the market for cryptocurrencies is wild. It’s one of the few places we’ve seen so much fear, greed and panic.\t So we felt that this is exactly when individual investors and consumers need some rational guidance that’s based on fact and not fiction. Wood: So as you’ve done this analysis, do you believe that there are cryptocurrencies that are stable and aren’t going to have wild fluctuations, and that do represent …\t I mean, I find it hard to believe that there are some that represent a good investment. Weiss: It’s like any other investment, especially new investments — or like any other new technology, the marketplace as a whole is very volatile, no doubt.\t But with that extra risk also comes a very unusual reward potential.

      "Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a regulatory wild west. This isn’t inherently a bad thing, as a lack of regulation sometimes allows technology and ideas that are ahead of their time to flourish when they might otherwise be constrained. There are pockets of ICO investing, however, that may be on the darker side of murky and, for the long-term health of the ICO ecosystem, may require regulation. In particular, a closer look should be taken at pre-sale ICO investments from institutional investors (venture capital funds, cryptocurrency hedge funds, etc.) and the impact these investments can have. When properly implemented, regulation can make markets more efficient and fair on the whole and plays an important part in the financial world.\tAn initial coin offering (ICO) is a means of crowdfunding a cryptocurrency project. In an ICO, some quantity of the cryptocurrency is preallocated to investors in the form of “tokens,” in exchange for other cryptocurrencies (or occasionally fiat currency, like dollars), commonly Bitcoin or Ethereum. These tokens become functional units of cryptocurrency if the ICO’s funding goal is met and the project launches. ICOs help a cryptocurrency launch by gaining funds for development costs, attracting developer attention to the project, and increasing usage and adoption of the coin by increasing the number of people who hold the coin. Developer adoption is important because, once a cryptocurrency project is launched, the development process has just begun and having the help and support of a large community is critical to its long-term success. ICOs are a low cost fundraising option because they avoid regulatory compliance and other interactions with intermediary financial institutions. ICOs usually take place over a period of days to weeks and are split into a pre-sale period and a public sale period with a funding cap that must be reached for the project to launch.\tA pre-sale is a token sale round that take place before a public token sale happens. The ability to buy tokens during this period is restricted to select individuals or institutions that are placed on a “whitelist” and allowed to buy coins before a public sale. Pre-sales often give a percent bonus number of coins to participants and sometimes require a minimum contribution amount.\tA pre-sale is a way to reward early supporters by guaranteeing them an allocation of tokens and to build up attention for a project over a series of weeks and months. Even the best projects must be adept at marketing and telling their story to gain funding and developer adoption; having a good team and a promising white paper (a document which details the goals and plans for a cryptocurrency project) is not enough. Having well known investors in a pre-sale (either as individuals or institutions) can increase hype and lead others to invest.\tGiven the current behavior of individual investors and the common lack of holding obligations for institutions in most ICOs, the current system could be exploited. Consider the following:\tThe combination of the above facts make participating in a pre-sale ICO round almost risk-free for firms with a strong following and a willingness to sell shortly after the hype of the public sale once a cryptocurrency is listed on an exchange. There is no evidence to suggest that this activity has been taking place, but for now, individuals should closely evaluate any ICOs before participating and not take the presence of well-respected investor as conclusive evidence of a project’s quality or likelihood of success. This is always sound advice but should be kept in mind given the opportunity for funds to leverage their position.\tFollow on Medium for future articles and find more at: https://twitter.com/phil_glazer\tBy clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.\tInvesting @ MGV.

      "Hannah Murphy in London\tBitFlyer, the Tokyo-based operator of one of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges, is expanding into Europe after receiving regulatory approval, as the infrastructure that supports cryptocurrency trading continues to grow off the back of the recent boom. \tThe exchange — which has an 80 per cent share of bitcoin trading in Japan and 20-30 per cent of the global market — is launching its European service on Tuesday after gaining a payment institution licence from Luxembourg’s financial regulator. \tThe platform, which allows users to store bitcoin and place complex trades, said it was responding to increased demand for cryptocurrency trading among professional and institutional investors. That audience is currently “underserved” in Europe, the company said. \tMore than 400 exchanges have sprung up across the globe in recent years to cater for crypto capital markets, many of which are unregulated. BitFlyer’s expansion comes as larger exchanges seek to legitimise a marketplace where investors, to date, have been afforded few protections despite the risk of extreme price volatility, hacks and service outages.\tBitFlyer was now the “most compliant virtual currency exchange in the world”, chief executive Yuzo Kano, a former Goldman Sachs trader said. “Approved regulatory status is fundamental to the long-term future of bitcoin and the virtual currency industry,” he added. \tThe price of a bitcoin tripled in value in the last two months of 2017, hitting an all-time high of nearly $20,000 and fuelling concerns among regulators of a bubble. Price rises were buoyed by the introduction of bitcoin futures trading in December on two traditional Chicago exchanges, the CME Group and Cboe Global Markets. The price has since fallen and is now trading closer to $10,000. \tBitFlyer, which also launched in the US in November, has become one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, raising $36m in venture capital funding, from blue-chip backers including Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui banks. In 2017, it facilitated more than $250bn of cryptocurrency trading on its platform — $150bn of which came in the final months of the year as prices surged. \tMr Kano last month told the Financial Times that soaring demand among Japanese investors for leveraged bitcoin trading, in particular, had driven prices higher. On its Tokyo platform, users are able to trade bitcoin proper as well as bitcoin derivatives with leverage of up to 15 times their cash deposits. \tIn Europe, the platform “won’t be offering leverage to start with but will be working with the regulator to discuss that in future”, said Andy Bryant, chief operating officer of the European division.\tMr Bryant added that the company would now be the only licensed European exchange offering cross-border trading with Japan, which he called “the deepest and largest market in the world”. \tThe company was granted a payment institution licence from Luxembourg’s Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, meaning it will have to carry out anti-money laundering checks when signing up customers, as a bank would. It also secured a banking partnership with an unnamed European bank. \t“We’re delighted that one of the most successful Japanese start-ups chose Luxembourg as their EU platform,” Pierre Gramegna, the country’s finance minister said on Tuesday. \tBitFlyer will only offer trading of bitcoin/euro pairs but said it planned to support other virtual currencies — such as Litecoin and Ethereum — and more fiat currencies in the coming months.\tInternational Edition\n",

The ETF started with $5 million in assets under management and has grown to around $400 million in just under a month, Masucci said.\tSince Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo, sending pot stocks tumbling, there is reason to be concerned when dealing big money in marijuana. But Masucci has accepted a degree of volatility, something he wasn't willing to do with cryptocurrency.\t\"We can't explain the volatility within bitcoin. Until we are comfortable with it and we know how to trade it, we don't see ourselves getting involved,\" he said.\tA majority of Alternative Harvest's companies are based in Canada or other countries, where legalization is impending or where regulations are more lax. As far as domestic companies go, Masucci said ETF Managers Group was careful to pick those best suited to benefit from the cannabis boom, like hydroponics company Scott's Miracle Gro or cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris.\t\"We will continue to participate in those companies that are largest, and right now, the largest piece is outside of the U.S.,\" Masucci said. \tDespite Sessions' actions, Masucci has high hopes that the U.S. cannabis industry will stick around. \t\"Twenty-eight states now have approved medical marijuana, 16 more have it on the docket for this year,\" Masucci said.\t\"There are so many medical advancements now happening with the cannabidiol oils and the uses of the plant, I don't see that going away,\" he added.\t\tPlaying\tShare this video...\tWatch Next...\n",

Known as BTCMiami, the conference was organized by the UAE-based Keynote, who has successfully led 12 blockchain and cryptocurrency events worldwide since 2012. \tEnjoying a rigorous reputation in the field of cryptocurrency and blockchain, NABC has been attracting company representatives, economists, researchers, and media operatives. Even a mobile app was particularly created for the sole purpose of networking among the conference attendees.\tAchain VP Kyle Liu Speaking at BTCMiami\tAchain, one of the world’s leading public blockchain platforms, had its spokesperson Kyle Lu share the basic principles as well as recent updates of its forking theory. The theory outlines Achain’s vision of a collaborative blockchain system — something that is rather divergent from the competitiveness and exclusiveness that most blockchain solutions tend to emphasize. That being said, under a mutual agreement from all participants (namely, the VEP), Achain fosters a full range of free communication, such as requesting, approving, executing, and returning feedbacks (mandatory for all constituent nodes).\tKyle Lu, vice president of Achain, has also founded ICO Star, a global crypto-assets investment platform. Meanwhile being a serial entrepreneur in big data and mobile internet, Kyle Lu is making waves in business transformation and disruptive technology adoption.\tAs of now, Achain serves as a foundation for multiple blockchain-based services and individual programs. It already runs more than 50 smart contracts and 30 digital assets.\tAchain’s booth at BTCMiami\tLater at the event, Achain opened up a Q&A booth to make its technology intelligible and accessible to its potential partners and the crowd. The project’s management executives regard the North American market as the team’s next strategic step.

      "The bitcoin craze has officially jumped to real estate. \tDespite the risky, volatile nature of cryptocurrency, homes and property across the U.S., Australia, Canada, and beyond are for sale for the unpredictable coin. Even after one bitcoin dropped from $14,000 to $11,000 in value in a matter of days, homeowners are still putting up their homes for some of that flashy money.\tSEE ALSO: Cool, so people are selling their houses in exchange for Bitcoin now\tIt's not just a few listings here and there. According to Bitcoin Real Estate,  a site that has been tracking the business for several years, the trend is growing more and more and not slowing down.\tAt the end of 2017 a Miami condo reportedly sold for 17.7 bitcoin and actual cryptocurrency was exchanged between the buyer and seller. Not just bitcoin converted into cash, which is the more popular way to use the coin.\tTrulia spokeswoman Andrea McDonald found 80 listings on the site that reference cryptocurrency in some way. Many just note \"bitcoin accepted,\" but others really get into it.\tA property near Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California makes that case for paying with cryptocurrency, insisting that the property \"can be a nice investment for future at a very reasonable $5,250 per acre for a total of $2.1 million or 124 bitcoins.\"\tAnother home in West Palm Beach, Florida, is open to buyers with bitcoin and ethereum and litecoin, but with the caveat that cryptocurrencies are constantly changing. \"Owner financing possible $149,900 USD, 13 bitcoin 375 ethereum, 950 litecoin (crypto price subject to change. Inquire crypto price at time of interest),\" the listing says.\tSo far Trulia hasn't officially seen a sale go down with the coin, McDonald said, but it's probably just a matter of time.\tSF real estate listings be like pic.twitter.com/yKPDmNc9uu\t— Jill Carlson (@_jillruth) January 12, 2018\tRedfin, another online real estate database, has also seen a crypto trend in its listings, especially in hubs like the Bay Area and Miami. The number of listings that accepted cryptocurrency jumped from 75 in December to 134 in mid-January. Some of those 134 listings have sold, but as a Redfin spokesman explained it's unclear if cryptocurrency was used for all or a portion of the sale price.\tSome of the listings are trying so hard to initiate a cryptosale. A Florida home used all caps and asterisks to lure in investors, screaming, \"**BITCOIN SALE PREFERRED! Unique opportunity to be one of the first transactions using Bitcoin.**\". Another listing for a property in Washington state, meanwhile, was generous with exclamation points: \"Seller willing to accept BITCOIN!!! The new rate of cryptocurrency that [sic] taking the world by storm!\" \tAaron Drucker, a Redfin agent in Miami, said in a phone call that including cryptocurrency in a listing gives a property more exposure. He's also noticed that bitcoin listings tend to be luxury condos. \"Earlier investors in bitcoin have made a lot of money,\" he said. \"They may want to convert some of that into a tangible asset.\"\t\"I wouldn’t recommend this for first-time home buyers.\"\tBut bitcoin sales aren't for everyone. \"I wouldn’t recommend this for first-time home buyers,\" he added. \"But if you want to buy a second home, this might be something to consider.\" No matter how you look it at, Drucker said, it's \"definitely risky.\"\tOthers are using bitcoin and other coins for their lucrative value. A Redfin agent in San Diego helped a buyer cash out two bitcoin valued then at nearly $7,500 each to cover closing costs for a home in Carlsbad, California. \tCarina Isentaeva, a Redfin agent in San Francisco, is in the center of the crypto-mania. In a call she said it's all about \"crypto homes\" now. She had a deal that fell through because the buyer's ICO flopped. But more surprising to Isentaeva was that the seller was willing to work with a cryptocurrency contingent sale. \"You couldn’t imagine this a few years ago,\" she said. \"Everyone would want to see a bank statement,\" not ICO filing paperwork.\tAnother big issue holding up more sales with actual cryptocurrency is regulation. Just finding an escrow service that will handle a crypto sale instead of traditional cash is difficult. As Isentaeva noted, the technology is moving much faster than government and laws. So the workaround is to convert bitcoin into cash and then buy property. But eventually the tech should catch up and the transaction will be more streamlined — at least that's what Isentaeva hopes.\tBut no matter the difficulties, the crypto listings keep coming. Welcome to the neighborhood, bitcoiners.\t\n",
      "-Bitcoin news, price, information & analysis\tIn a lengthy document to their highest profile clients, the Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management division has warned about the danger of investing in cryptocurrency. For the banking giant, the rise in Bitcoin and other digital currencies during 2017 is a sure signal that the entire space is in an economic bubble.\tTypically for crypto naysayers, during the 108 page document the authors mention the Dutch “Tulipmania” of the seventh century, as well as the “dot-com” bubble of the turn of this century. However, they also go on to highlight the surge in the price of the stocks of firms loosely associating themselves with the cryptocurrency space:\t“The mania surrounding cryptocurrencies is probably even better illustrated by the price surges seen in companies that announce some type of affiliation with blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies.”\tFor Goldman Sachs, recent examples like Long Blockchain (LBCC) (formerly Long Island Ice Tea Group) and the Crypto Company (previously a sports bra company) seeing the value of their shares increase by a percentage of five figures is clear evidence of an economic bubble.\tDuring the document, Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani and Brett Nelson (both senior officials at the Investment Strategy Group Goldman Sachs) do acknowledge some practical uses for the rapidly growing technology behind cryptocurrency. Again, they reiterated the enthusiasm for blockchain common amongst most central bankers of the world. However, for them Bitcoin does not provide enough of the advantages that other digital currencies could potentially deliver. They write:\t“We think the concept of a digital currency that leverages blockchain technology is viable given the benefits it could provide: ease of execution globally, lower transaction costs, reduction of corruption since all transactions could be traced, safety of ownership, and so on. But bitcoin does not provide any of these key advantages. Quite the contrary. Not only is there no ease of execution, but settlement often takes as many as 10 days. In late 2017, the price discrepancies among 17 US exchanges for one bitcoin amounted to $4,156, or about a 31% difference between the high and low prices. Transaction costs have skyrocketed, and frequent hacking has wiped out entire wallets and exchanges of their bitcoin holdings.”\tThe pair go on to highlight their scepticism that Bitcoin and other cryptos will maintain their current value in the long run. They’re also doubtful that cryptocurrency will replace the dollar as a global reserve currency.\tThe document, titled “(Un) Steady as She Goes” does not focus purely on Bitcoin, however. It serves as a round up of the various events happening in the previous 12 months that have affected the value of the dollar. It was sent exclusively to Goldman’s wealthiest clients. To be considered worthy of membership of the firm’s Private Wealth Management division, clients must have at least $10 million in assets that are available for investment purposes.\t \t \t \tshame on you talking about bitcoin (your worst enemy Nr 1 ) its natural goldman sachs talks like this regarding bitcoin rulles de world and put banks in danger …\tGoldman Sachs and its handling of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the 2007 financial crisis.\tYep, glad they have our back.

      "Litecoin has had a quite good public image in 2017, adding to the phenomenal rise from around $4 to a peak of $370. However, as the digital asset came into the spotlight, and the Litecoin Foundation tentatively started to promote Litecoin more, criticisms appeared.\t Popularity came with closer scrutiny, and a previously drama-free coin acquired its own negative points.  Bullish on Litecoin Price: Top 5 Reasons for the Litecoin Boom With a lot of newcomers to the world of cryptocurrency, Litecoin would not be seen as a staple, but as just another coin deserving renewed scrutiny. And while older investors may be used to Litecoin, the renewed popularity brings the spotlight to the flaws.\t 1. Litecoin was artificially inflated: Litecoin was added to Coinbase last spring, and some see the move as artificial, mostly due to the influence of Charlie Lee as the technical director.\t From then onward, Litecoin quickly appreciated, and Charlie Lee became one of the most influential voices in the crypto community. In November and December, Litecoin saw another rapid appreciation, breaking above $100, coinciding with an appearance of Charlie Lee on CNBC TV.\t Without the accidental publicity, Litecoin had a rather negative image among traders, being called a “chicken” for its short-lived flights. Some believe the current values of Litecoin are not fair and the coin was pushed to the front without too much merit, being simply a copy of Bitcoin.  2.

The government agency alleges that Dean, through TEH, conducted a “fraudulent Ponzi-style” scheme, misappropriated funds and failed to register with the CFTC “in any capacity.”\tDean did not respond to requests for comment. Due to the government shutdown, officials for the CFTC could not be reached, according to a recorded message greeting callers to the agency.\tMore than 600 investors gave at least $1.1 million worth of Bitcoin to TEH,which promised that it would be pooled and invested in various options. The CFTC claims that, rather than investing, Dean used the funds to pay other investors, “in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.”\t“Defendants were not actually engaged in trading on behalf of their customers, and Defendants’ purported trading profits were fictitious,” the CFTC statement read. “As alleged in the Complaint, Defendants stopped making payments to their customers, having misappropriated over $1 million in customers’ funds.”\tAngry investors first alerted the Daily Camera to Dean’s alleged fraud in December, after he posted a message to a private Facebook group alleging that TEH was hit by hackers. Requests for refunds were intermittently honored, and communication with Dean became less and less frequent.\tNo money was ever returned to Louisiana-based investor Collin Bercier, who says he invested $50,000 worth of Bitcoin with TEH. Given the crypto-currency’s recent meteoric rise, that initial investment would be worth well over $1 million today, he said.\tTo read more of this story go to dailycamera.com\n",

      "When the mystical Satoshi Nakamoto implemented the first blockchain a decade ago, they probably didn’t imagine it would explode into the disruptive force it is today. Initially used to support the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, various iterations of the blockchain are increasingly finding their way into industries outside of fintech, bringing unprecedented change to these industries.\tThe blockchain, a decentralized ledger that permanently records transactions on its network, has provided the building blocks for many of the disruptive trends we’ve seen in recent years. It has seen the rise of dozens of cryptocurrencies in addition to bitcoin, some of which have had a wild rally in 2017, including bitcoin itself.\tWe’ve also seen Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), the blockchain-based funding model, become more valuable than some traditional funding models. In 2017, ICO-backed startups raised over $3.2 billion in funding from token sales, surpassing amounts raised by early-stage VC funding.\tBut perhaps the most interesting applications of the blockchain have come from its use away from its parent industry, fintech. It’s been used in real estate, record management, asset tracking, and has shown a lot of promise in healthcare, identity management, and dozens of other traditional niches.\tHere are some of the most interesting implementations of the blockchain you’ll likely see this year.\tReal Estate\tTowards the end of last year, the first known blockchain-based real estate transaction was completed when TechCrunch co-founder, Michael Arrington, snapped up a Ukrainian apartment for about $60,000 via the Ethereum blockchain. The transaction was conducted entirely via smart contracts, a feature native to the Ethereum blockchain.\tThe sale represented one of the neatest implementations of the blockchain in the real world. Soon, blockchain-powered startups such as Ubitquity and Propy, the real estate company that brokered the Ukrainian transaction, will be helping everyday clients search for apartments, organize their storage lots, and close overseas property deals without ever visiting a bank or a lawyer.\tMedia\tThere’s also been increased interest in the blockchain from both old and new media companies, primarily because of the potential to transform content distribution.\tAt the 2018 edition of the CES tech exhibition, Kodak announced plans to launch its own token, the KodakCoin, to help manage licensing and image rights for photographers. KodakCoin would run on a blockchain designed to keep track of image rights and compensate creators for their work.\tComcast is also perfecting its blockchain-powered ad network, enabling companies to buy ads on over-the-top (OTT) and broadcast TV via the blockchain.\tIn addition to Kodak and Comcast, a good number of startups are helping bring blockchain technologies into traditional media.\tMedical and healthcare\tThe blockchain’s decentralized network also makes it a perfect fit for the healthcare industry, especially in the areas of supply chain management, record keeping, and asset tracking.\tAnd it’s not only early-stage startups that are using the blockchain to tackle healthcare issues. Last year, IBM Watson and the US FDA signed an agreement to develop a blockchain-based system to keep track of patient data from medical records, genome testing, clinical trials, and other traditional sources of patient data.\tIt’s definitely going to be a fun and interesting year for the blockchain.\t\n",

      "Hey look, a visual representation of Bitcoin prices. Photo by Priscilla Du Preez on Unsplash Just like a hiker hoofing up and down across a jagged mountain range, anyone who follows the price of Bitcoin is probably getting pretty tired.\t From a high of over $19,000 in December of last year to around $10,000 today, the price has been changing so quickly that any news coverage of it is quickly out of date. As if the wild changes weren’t enough, the price can even vary slightly depending on where you look for it.\t Here’s what generates those crazy prices, and the small differences between them, that you might see the next time you shop for cryptocurrencies. The price at any moment is a natural result of the trading that happens on cryptocurrency exchanges in a process called price discovery.\t For example, consider Coinbase.com— a popular hub, or brokerage, for people who want to buy or sell Bitcoin. If you purchase there, the entity selling you the cryptocurrency is actually Coinbase itself.\t Coinbase.com has a sister site, called GDAX, which stands for Global Digital Asset Exchange—that’s a marketplace for professional traders and institutions, and that’s where the price discovery happens. The price of the last trade on GDAX is the value of Bitcoin there at the moment, and that’s also the basis for the price you see on Coinbase.com.

Essentially, he says, bitcoin is attempting to solve a problem that never existed. \t \"We have a good medium of exchange called the dollar,\" he told Tom Keene of \"Bloomberg Surveillance\" on Tuesday morning from the snow-capped Swiss peaks. \"We can trade in that. Why do people want bitcoin?

The decline has been driven in part by fear of increased regulation in major Asian economies like South Korea and China. \t\n",

Anonymous sources have said that the closure is based on the fact that the exchange accounts were being used for a different reason than for what they were initially opened for.\tIt has previously been reported that even though India has not banned cryptocurrencies, the government has been attempting to regulate exchanges.\tSuspicious Transaction Reports need to be filed with the Financial Intelligence Unit by banks if anything out of the ordinary comes up on the accounts of the exchanges. A banker who prefers to remain anonymous said:\tWe have asked some of these companies to explain the businesses that they are involved in and why it was not specified when opening the accounts. We will also be flagging some of these suspicious transactions with the concerned agencies.\t\tIn addition to the closures, the banks are seeking more collateral on loans, and have also banned cash withdrawals from some exchanges.\tA source said:\tSince last month, banks have been asking for additional collateral with 1:1 ratio.\tSources have said that 10 exchanges have been targeted including Unocoin, Zebpay, CoinSecure, and BtcxIndia. The latter three, and most of the banks, have not responded to the suspension claims.\tAn emailed response from Sathvik Vishwanath, a promoter of Unocoin, to Economic Times stated:\tThe banks have not contacted the company or the promoters regarding the actions you have mentioned.\tIn addition, an anonymous banker involved has said:\tReserve Bank of India has not issued any directive to us, it’s a cautionary move on our part. We are wary about the purpose for which some of these current accounts are being used.\t\tAuthorities have also been looking into the tax implications of these exchanges, of which the top 10 could account for as much as $6 billion. A tax official who is part of a team looking into possibly applying a sales tax on Bitcoin exchanges had this to say:\tThese exchanges tend to show the total volumes both on buy and sell side as their revenue. In many instances, the exchanges themselves buy and sell cryptocurrencies on their own platform.\tA suspension of accounts will result in an inevitable cashflow issue for these exchanges, leading promoters to even offer their personal property as collateral. Even so, an investment banker has said that these platforms produce high revenue and strong margins. He did, however, add:\tWe would not like to invest till the taxation part is clarified.\tAs in most countries, tax processes on cryptocurrencies still remain unclear in India.

      "\thttp://mybs.in/2VjrETa\t\tCritics of Bitcoin often argue that it’s useless as a means of payment, one of the key elements of any successful currency. That’s not quite right, and likely to become less so.\t\r\n",
      "First, a reminder on how Bitcoin works. If I want to send someone some Bitcoin, I simply broadcast my intention to the network. I then wait for the transaction to be picked up by “miners,” who process transactions in return for fees and newly minted Bitcoin. If all goes well, my transaction will be included in a block, which becomes part of the global immutable ledger known as the Bitcoin blockchain. (Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin, because as a blockchain engineer I sometimes receive it as payment.)\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite complaints about the lack of usability, the network is being used to make a lot of payments. In the last three months of 2017, it processed almost $150 billion in transactions, nearly ten times what it did a year earlier and more than seven times what Western Union moves among consumers in a typical quarter. It’s important to note, though, that the actual number of transactions hasn’t changed -- it’s the average value of each transaction that keeps growing.document.write(\"<!--\");if(isUserBanner==\"free\"&&(displayConBanner==1))document.write(\"-->\");googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/6516239/outofpage_1x1_desktop','div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0').addService(googletag.pubads());googletag.pubads().enableSyncRendering();googletag.enableServices();});\n",
      "\t\r\n",
      "Granted, this is far from an ideal system if you want to pay for a cup of coffee. That’s because transactions must compete to get picked up by miners, who favor the ones that offer the biggest fees. Somebody who wants to move $1 million can easily afford to offer $20, but someone who wants to buy a pizza probably can’t. As a result, smaller transactions can languish -- a sort of inequality that has led some to accuse Bitcoin of becoming just another toy for the elite.\t\r\n",
      "What to do? One popular workaround involves exchanges and wallet providers such as Coinbase and Xapo, which hold Bitcoin on behalf of millions of individual customers. Coinbase last year estimated that they were storing about 10 percent of all bitcoin in circulation, and others have similarly large balances. People who use the same provider can make Bitcoin payments to one another instantly, through the provider’s own books, without the cost or delay of broadcasting to the blockchain. Xapo, for example, processes about 500,000 transactions a day off the blockchain, and only 30,000 on.\t\r\n",
      "So transactions can be fast and cheap, as long as users are willing to rely on a trusted central counterparty -- but that’s exactly the kind of system that Bitcoin was designed to subvert. Not to mention the fact that wallet providers and exchanges have become prime targets for hackers.\t\r\n",
      "So how can regular folks transact in Bitcoin while remaining true to its peer-to-peer ethos? A fledgling network called Lightning offers one solution: It allows people to create two-way channels through which they can make numerous small payments, with only the final balances settled on the blockchain. To deal with the issue of trust, it requires users to put down deposits that can be forfeited if they fail to make good on their obligations.\t\r\n",
      "Lightning is still in its infancy, and might not be enough to make Bitcoin universally accessible. It does, however, have the potential to offer low-cost payment processing while retaining Bitcoin’s permissionless nature. Other solutions based on the same technology might even enable decentralized exchanges.\t\n",
      "Bitcoin will never be the universal communal ledger that many early advocates imagined. It’s simply not realistic to replicate every petty cash transfer on computers all around the world. That said, if the Bitcoin blockchain acts as a sort of wholesale settlement backbone for numerous retail networks such as Lightning, it could yet fulfill the goal of creating a genuine peer-to-peer payment system. That would be an impressive achievement in itself.\t\r\n",

      "-Bitcoin news, price, information & analysis\tTwo of Scandinavia’s largest banks have expressed their concern over Bitcoin and other digital currencies. According to a memo sent on Monday, Nordea will no longer allow its employees to trade cryptocurrency. \tThe ban was confirmed by a phone call received by news outlet Bloomberg which also set a date for the new regulation coming into effect – February 28. Afroditi Kellburg, a spokesperson at the bank cites the “unregulated nature” of the digital currency market as reasoning behind the decision. Additional concerns were the lack of protective measures in place to support investors in the space and the lack of transparency some cryptos have. Finally, Kellburg also highlighted issues with volatility and liquidity to the news source.\tThe policy from Nordea will include some “transitional provision for staff with existing holdings” and will allow “for certain exceptions”. This means that any of the 31,500 current employees at the financial institution will be able to keep their existing crypto holdings.\tMeanwhile, another Scandinavian bank has also expressed skepticism about the cryptocurrency market. Danske Bank A/S is the second largest Nordic bank. They too are discouraging employees from trading digital currencies. However, they are yet to make a decision on whether a similar blanket ban is required. Danske spokesperson Kenni Leth told the news source via email:\t“We’re sceptical toward cryptocurrencies and are advising our employees not to trade them, but we don’t impose an actual ban… We’re currently analysing the situation and time will tell whether there’ll be a formal ban.”\tNeither of the aforementioned Nordic banks currently offer any products for their clients to get involved with the cryptocurrency space. In the same email, Leth from Danske Bank stated:\t“Due to lack of maturity and transparency in the various cryptocurrencies, we have decided not to provide trading of such securities on our various investment platforms.”\tToday’s sentiment coming from the two banking institutions is in line with that expressed by Nordea’s Chief Executive Office Casper von Koskull. In an interview from last December, he called Bitcoin an “absurd” construction alleging that it completely defied logic. He went on to highlight an oft-repeated criticism of cryptocurrency, that it’s used to conduct financial crimes.\tMeanwhile the European Banking Federation have yet to impose any regulation surrounding Bitcoin. However, a spokesperson for them, Raymond Frenken, has also weighed on the topic of banks banning investment in cryptocurrency. Bloomberg report:\t“If banks like Nordea are going to have a very specific policy on this — and we’re hearing regulators are taking a look at this, including the ECB and central banks — probably it will be that it’s changing. With developments like this, it’s more likely that it will have to be discussed in the context of the European Banking Federation.”\tThe EBF spokesperson concluded by stating that this was the first they’d heard of a bank banning Bitcoin investments. “This could very well be a first”.\t \tAbsolute scum journalism, fud title for clickbait.\tSo, a bank(fiat) doesn’t want it’s employees to trade crypos(which is decentralised and they could anyways)….

      "-Bitcoin news, price, information & analysis\tBitcoin Price Key Highlights\tBitcoin price continued its slump and may be setting its sights on the lower Fib extension levels.\tTechnical Indicators Signals\tThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse.\tThese moving averages are close to the channel resistance, adding an extra upside barrier in the event of a test. If selling pressure persists, bitcoin price could break through the 38.2% level then move on to the 50% extension at $9148.52.\tThe next support is at the 61.8% extension at the bottom of the channel around $8200 then the 76.4% extension is located at $7066.67. Stronger selling momentum could lead to move all the way down to the full extension at $5205.62.\tStochastic is pulling up from the oversold region, though, indicating that buyers could take over price action and probably lead to a move up to the area of interest at $13,000-14,000. RSI, on the other hand, is still pointing down to signal that sellers are in control.\t\tMarket Factors\tThe dollar drew some support from the passage of the funding bill in Congress that effectively ends the government shutdown. Equities and bond yields also ticked higher, drawing investors back to the U.S. markets again.\tMeanwhile, bitcoin price tumbled once more as South Korean regulators took more steps to remove anonymity in transactions. The Vice Chairman of the Financial Services Commission real names on a virtual coin exchange wallet and bank account must be the same for a user to be able to make deposits starting January 30.\tlifes-a-bitch-coin.\tLove a sellers market to be frank #frankcoin\tGet the latest news delivered to your inbox.\tFirst marketplace to sell & buy sensor data\tA next-generation blockchain commerce (bCommerce) infrastructure\tBlockchain platform for HR and educational services\tCrypto-based KYC checking platform\tCrypto economy zone\tReal estate platform of the future with blockchain technology\tCrypto-based loyalty platform\tHotel casino with crypto-economics\tcrypto mining company with extra low energy costs\tFinancial services platform\tCryptocurrency recycling mechanism\tUp to 100% cashback online and offline marketplace\tGlobal decentralized marketplace\tfixed income assets network\tCatalyzing the Future of Collaboration\tCrypto-Financial Services Network\tCryptocurrency based on natural resources \tPeer-to-peer (P2P) financing platform\tMovies streaming and film funding platform\tA blockchain based electricity trading & bidding platform\tAI for cryptocurrency price prediction\tСardboard building-sets for children and adults\tSocial platform for visual content monetization\tSmart reputation management on the blockchain\tFintech company that is building a base protocol to solve the payments challenges of today\tBlockchain platform for investment in neuro-medicine and neuro-technologies.\tBlockchain-enabled business platform\tplatform on blockchain for group investments\tPlatform created for soccer fans and team managements worldwide\tOnline shop with crypto payment\tNewsBTC is a news service that covers bitcoin news, technical analysis & forecasts for bitcoin and other altcoins.
